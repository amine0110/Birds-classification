# Birds-classification

Link to the article [here](https://pycad.co/birds-classification-using-deep-learning/)

Hello eveyone.

In this project, our object is to create a program that help us to do birds classification with 225 type of birds using Python and Tensorfolw.

So this project is devided in three parts:
- The first one is to do the training with the DATASET that we have, in my case I have a GPU Nvidia 1050 and the training took about 7 hours to be completed with 20   epochs and the total number of images was about 30000 image.

- The second part is to load the model and try it if everything worke correctly

- And the last part is to deploy the model in a desktop application built using Tkinter and Python.

You can find the DATASET that we used in Kaggle using this link:

This is an image of how the final desktop application looks :)
